## Overview

Drata ISO 27001 Hub is a centralized resource and tooling hub within Drata’s compliance automation platform. It provides research, playbooks, checklists, and guided workflows to help organizations understand, implement, and operationalize ISO 27001, while leveraging Drata’s continuous compliance capabilities across multiple frameworks.

## Key Capabilities

- Central hub focused on ISO 27001 understanding and implementation
- Complements Drata’s broader continuous compliance and audit-readiness platform
- Supports scaling ISO 27001 alongside other frameworks (e.g., SOC 2, NIST CSF) using shared controls
- Designed for GRC teams, compliance leaders, and security practitioners seeking automated ISO 27001 evidence collection and monitoring

## Features

### ISO 27001–Centric Resources
- Structured educational content to understand ISO 27001 requirements
- Implementation guidance through research, playbooks, and checklists
- Learning materials to help teams adopt and mature an ISO 27001-aligned ISMS

### Continuous Compliance Platform (ISO 27001 and Beyond)
- **Automated evidence collection** across systems relevant to ISO 27001 controls
- **Continuous control monitoring** to maintain audit readiness
- **Control ownership assignment** so remediation and accountability are clearly tracked
- **Shared control mapping** to reuse ISO 27001 controls across other frameworks (e.g., SOC 2, NIST CSF), reducing duplication

- Up-to-date control statuses and early surfacing of issues
- Centralized view of **controls, policies, risks, and evidence** relevant to ISO 27001
- Reporting capabilities for leadership on current compliance readiness and risk

### Centralized Governance
- Single source of truth for ISO 27001 controls, policies, and associated risks
- Support for organizations operating across **multiple regions and cloud environments**
- Workflows and workspaces that can be tailored to specific teams or business units

## Use Cases

- Implementing ISO 27001 from scratch using guided materials and checklists
- Maintaining continuous ISO 27001 compliance and audit readiness
